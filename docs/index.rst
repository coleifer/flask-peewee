flask-peewee
============

.. warning::

    This package is in maintenance-only mode!
    -----------------------------------------

    I'm sorry to announce that flask-peewee will now be in maintenance-only mode. This decision is motivated by a number of factors:

    * `Flask-Admin <http://flask-admin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ provides a superior admin interface and has support for peewee models.
    * `Flask-Security <https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Security/>`_ and `Flask-Login <https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ both provide authentication functionality, and work well with Peewee.
    * Most importantly, though, I do not find myself wanting to work on flask-peewee.

    I plan on rewriting the ``Database`` and ``REST API`` portions of flask-peewee and repackaging them as a new library, but flask-peewee as it stands currently will be in maintenance-only mode.

------------------------------

Welcome to the flask-peewee documentation!

provides a layer of integration between the `flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_
web framework and the `peewee orm <http://peewee.rtfd.org/>`_.
